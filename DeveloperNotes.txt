Requirements for build

1 - CocoaPods installed on development computer

 Installation:
 Within Terminal.app:
  $ sudo gem install cocoapods


 Note:
 If you get the following error:
  ERROR:  Error installing cocoapods:
  activesupport requires Ruby version >= 2.2.2.

 You may run the following command in Terminal.app:
  $ sudo gem install activesupport -v 4.2.6

 Then re-run the cocoapod install command to complete the cocoapods installation.


2 - CocoaPod set up for project

 Within Terminal.app:

  $ cd PATH_TO_DTERM_DIRECTORY
  $ pod install


 This should set up the Pods.xcodeproj project for the DTerm project.


If all went well, then you can open up the DTerm.xcworkspace workspace and have fun.
